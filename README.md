# University-Life-Simulator
An android game developed to simulate what itâ€™s like going to UofT! Developed the game using the SOLID principles and design patterns as a guide.

###   Gameplay

Here the three games represent taking 3 courses at UofT. Each game includes 3 levels with a bonus
4th level that represent the assignments required to pass the course/game. The scores calculated for
the first two assignments/levels in the games represent 1.0 GPA point each and the last level
three represents 2.0 GPA points. These GPA points total to give the GPA attained on the entire
course/game. The overall GPA of the student player is the average of the GPA attained in each of the
courses. The bookstore provides the student players with boosters to help improve their performance
on their courses/games. The app result page shows the graduation of the student with their final GPA.
The leaderboard shows the top 5 ranking student players of this Student Life Simulator.

#### Game 1: Math Mania
The player is required to answer math questions in lightning rounds. Each round lasts 60 seconds and
the player is required to get a set number of points to pass each level. The difficulty of the levels
varies as the player progresses through the levels. Level 1 is the introductory math course and the player
is required to get 5 points to continue to the next game; the range of numbers possible is from 1-10.
In Level 2, the player is required to get 5 points but the range of numbers is from 1-25. In Level 3,
the player is required to get 8 points and the range of numbers is from 1-50; although this time there
is negtive marking for incorrect answers. In the Bonus Level, users can play an easier version of the
game to gain "giftcards" that can be used to purchase booster items in the BookStore. In this game,
the booster item is a Calculator, which gives the player a small range in which the answer lies. If
the player has enough calculators, they can use them in Level2, Level3 and the Bonus Level if they are
stuck.

#### Game 2: Catching Grades
The players are required to catch stuff that are falling from the sky. Each level differs from each
other. Level 1 is the easiest level, which students will be catching grades, and there will be no
points reduction. Level 2 requires user to actions that you should do in university, avoid actions
that you should not do and catching grades along side. Catching an action that you should not do in
university will reduce your points. Level 3 has a killing object apart from all other objects mentioned.
Catching a killing object ends the game immediately. Level 4 contains all obejcts in Level 3, but
everything falls at a faster speed.
Players can buy an umbrella in the bookstore to reduce the difficulty of the game. It blocks
point reduction if you caught an action that you should not do in university. It is only available to
Level 2 beyond. For each game, the player can only use once for 10 second. Please be noted that the
umbrella will be gone if you pause and resume the game.

#### Game 3: Archery Club
The players are required to hit the targets with the given arrow. Each assignment has a different
challenge involved. Level 1 is most basic level wherein the target shifts in a row with varying
speed. Level 2 involves the target moving in different horizontal levels. Level 3 has the target
move diagonally on the screen. The bonus Level 4 has a changing windspeed resulting in the arrow
shifting vertically. The booster for this game is a special arrow that increases the score by 2
points every time it hits the target.
